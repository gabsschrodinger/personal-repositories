Each article/page is composed of one folder with two files, a markdown file, containing the content of the article/page, and one JSON file, with the article/page metadata.

The JSON metadata file should contain the following properties:
- "title": A string representing the article's title, case sensitive.
- "tags": An array of strings with the article's topics/categories.
