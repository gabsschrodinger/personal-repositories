# Windowing Functions in SQL

After working mainly with pySpark for several months, I have became quite rusty on windowing functions in plain SQL. This short article serves as an introduction and a short consultation material for windowing functions in SQL.

## What are windowing functions and when should you use them?

Windowing functions are a feature of the SQL language that allows developers to perform analytical and complex operations over a window, or partition (Masood-Al-Farooq, 2014).
